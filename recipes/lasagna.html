    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
      type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
      several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as
      meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, the word lasagna was used to describe a pot in which food was
      being cooked rather than the pasta itself. Lasagna recipes have been
      around for ages, dating back to as early as the thirteenth century. Today,
      lasagnas come in all kinds of varieties from veggies and cream sauces to
      traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as meat lasagnas.

      Originated in Italy during the middle ages, lasagna has been attributed to
      the city of Naples.

      <li>
        Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in
        the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and
        discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the
        grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3
        uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup
        sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce,
        mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of
        the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an
        additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
